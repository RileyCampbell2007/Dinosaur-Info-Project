        <h2>Stegosaurus</h2>
        
        <p>
            <i>Stegosaurus</i> is a genus of herbivorous,
        four-legged, armored dinosaur from the Late
        <b>Jurassic</b>,<br> characterized by the distinctive kite-shaped
        upright plates along their backs and spikes on their<br>
        tails. Fossils of the genus have been found in the
        western United States and in Portugal, where<br> they
        are found in <b>Kimmeridgian-</b> to early <b>Tithonian-aged</b>
        strata, dating to between 155 and<br> 145 million years
        ago.

            <i>Stegosaurus</i>, one of the many dinosaurs
        described in the Bone Wars, was first collected
        by<br> Arthur Lakes and consisted of several caudal
        vertebrae, a dermal plate, and several additional<br>
        postcranial elements that were collected north
        of Morrison, Colorado at Lakes' YPM Quarry 5.
