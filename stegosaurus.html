        <p>
            <i>Stegosaurus</i> is a genus of herbivorous,
        four-legged, armored dinosaur from the Late
        <b>Jurassic</b>, characterized by the distinctive kite-shaped
        upright plates along their backs and spikes on their
        tails. Fossils of the genus have been found in the
        western United States and in Portugal, where they
        are found in <b>Kimmeridgian-</b> to early <b>Tithonian-aged</b>
        strata, dating to between 155 and 145 million years
        ago.

            <i>Stegosaurus</i>, one of the many dinosaurs
        described in the Bone Wars, was first collected
        by Arthur Lakes and consisted of several caudal
        vertebrae, a dermal plate, and several additional
        postcranial elements that were collected north
        of Morrison, Colorado at Lakes' YPM Quarry 5.
