        <p>
            Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the
        clade Dinosauria. They first appeared during the <b>Triassic</b>
        period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago (mya),
        and when extinct about 65 to 66 mya. This group of
        animals dominated the Earth from the ocean floor to the
        skies above. There was no major group of organisms that
        the dinosaurs competed with besides small mammals.

            Around 66 million years ago, at the end of the
        <b>Cretaceous</b> period, an asteroid struck the Earth,
        triggering a mass extinction that killed off the
        dinosaurs and some 75% of all species. Somehow
        mammals survived, thrived, and became dominant
        across the planet.
